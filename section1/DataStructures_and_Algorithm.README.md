**DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHM**

Data Structure is a method to store information
Algorithms are methods to solve problem.

data structure is a way data is arranged and efficiently stored on the memory.

Applications are programs that accesses the data efficently.


**Data structures are divided into two categories**
    1. Linear Data Structures
    2. Non Linear Data Structures

**Linear Data Structures**
    a. Stacks
    b. Queues
    c. Linked Lists

**Non Linear Data Structures**
    a. Trees
    b. Heeps
    c. Graphs


**what is Algorithms**
to solve any problem in computing you need to device or plan certain steps. algorithms is a set of instructions or rules that perform a particular task or operation in a finit amount of time

key points:
    set of instructions
    plan or blueprint
    execute finite amount of time

**Why Algorithm?**
we need a mechanism to compare algorithms and to prediction the performance. we must the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete a task.

key points:
    Mechanism to compare Algorithms
    Predict Performance
    Time and amount of resources
