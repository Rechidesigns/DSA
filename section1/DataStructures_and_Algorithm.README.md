## DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHM

Data Structure is a method to store information
Algorithms are methods to solve problem.

data structure is a way data is arranged and efficiently stored on the memory.

Applications are programs that accesses the data efficently.



## Data structures are divided into two categories

    1. Linear Data Structures
    2. Non Linear Data Structures

**Linear Data Structures**

    a. Stacks
    b. Queues
    c. Linked Lists

**Non Linear Data Structures**

    a. Trees
    b. Heeps
    c. Graphs



## What is Algorithms

to solve any problem in computing you need to device or plan certain steps. algorithms is a set of instructions or rules that perform a particular task or operation in a finit amount of time

key points:
    set of instructions
    plan or blueprint
    execute finite amount of time


## Why Algorithm?

we need a mechanism to compare algorithms and to prediction the performance. we must the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete a task.

key points:
    Mechanism to compare Algorithms
    Predict Performance
    Time and amount of resources


## Abstract Data Type-ADT

**What is data type?**
Data type is basicaly the representation of data and the operation of the data.

Primitive Data Type 

    a. Intigers, Byte, Long, Float, Double
    b. Boolean, Characters

**Representaion**

int X;

    a. Memory - 4 bytes


char s[10];

    b. Memory = 2 bytes

**Operations**

int X;

    - Arithmetic Operations:
    +,-,*,/,%

    - Relational Operators
    <, ==, >, !=


char s[10];

    - Arithemetic Operator:
    + (which is used for concatination)
    Length()
    Capacity()
    Search()


## Abstraction

Abstract simply means hiding details.
it is a fundamental principle of Object Oriented Programming. in OOP we can can define our own classes and create objects of those classes, meaning we can create our own data types.

**Abstract Data Types**

when abstraction is applied to design of data structures we get abstract data types, abstract data types can also be called as mathematical model of Data Structures.

**Abstract Data Types Specifies:**

    a. Type of data represented or stored
    b. Operations Supported
    c. Parameters for operations

*ADT specifies WHAT each operation does, NOT HOW operations are done.*
